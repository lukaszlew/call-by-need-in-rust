# Call-By-Need Lambda Calculus in Rust

I went on a journey to learn more about how Haskell's runtime works and this repo is the result.

The implementation turned out to be pretty compact (say 100-200 LOC).
I also added some comments for your enjoyment.
This is a one-file implementation with examples.

All resides in [src/main.rs](https://github.com/lukaszlew/call-by-need-in-rust/blob/main/src/main.rs).
